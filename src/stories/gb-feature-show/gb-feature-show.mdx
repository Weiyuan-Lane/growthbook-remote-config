# &lt;gb-feature-show&gt;

This component is used to identify if it should be shown, given some feature flag in [GrowthBook](https://www.growthbook.io/)

It can be used in four different remote config types in GrowthBook. 
- Simple - `boolean` value delivered to all users
- Targeted - `boolean` value delivered to a targeted segment of users
- Percentage Rollout - `boolean` values delivered to a percentage of users
- A/B Experiment - `boolean` values delivered to a A/B/C/etc bucket of users

Under any of the remote config above, as long as a `true` value is returned, the component will be displayed, allowing us to use this in versatile ways

### Example
```html
<gb-feature-show
  gb-feature-key="some-key"
  [gb-default-val]="true">
  <button>Button Text Here</button>  
</gb-feature-show>
```
If `some-key` feature in GrowthBook is configured to `true`, the above will be visible. Else, it will be hidden

### Options
| Name           | Description                              | Default |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------|:--------|
| gb-feature-key | Feature key that is used on GrowthBook   | `""`    |
| gb-default-val | Default/fallback state of this component | `false` |
